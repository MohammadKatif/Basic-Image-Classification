# Basic Image Classification Convolutional Neural Network Model

This is a basic image classification Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) made using the Pytorch machine learning library, which classifies 32x32 RGB images into 10 classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck. The dataset utilized in this project is the CIFAR10 dataset of Pytorch.

**This project was just created by me to learn how basic image classification is done using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python.**
