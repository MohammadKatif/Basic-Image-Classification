# Basic-image-classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-
This is a basic image classification Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) made using the Pytorch machine learning library, which classifies 32x32 RGB images into 10 classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck. The dataset utilized in this project is the CIFAR10 dataset of Pytorch.
